# Compass

A simple and beautiful compass application for Android, built with modern development practices.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Real-time Orientation**: Displays the device's real-time orientation.
*   **True & Magnetic Heading**: Toggle between true north and magnetic north readings.
*   **Magnetic Declination**: Automatically calculates and displays magnetic declination based on your location.
*   **Modern UI**: Clean and minimalist user interface built with Jetpack Compose.
*   **Location**: Shows current latitude, longitude, and elevation.
*   **Built with Kotlin**: Fully written in Kotlin, following official guidelines.

## üß≠ True vs Magnetic Heading

### Magnetic Heading
- Points toward Earth's magnetic north pole
- Affected by local magnetic anomalies and interference
- Varies by location due to magnetic declination
- More susceptible to device interference and nearby metal objects

### True Heading
- Points toward geographic north (true north)
- More accurate for navigation and mapping
- Requires magnetic declination calculation
- Better for outdoor activities and navigation

The app automatically calculates magnetic declination based on your location and allows you to toggle between true and magnetic heading modes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Android Studio (latest stable version)
*   JDK 17 or higher

### Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
